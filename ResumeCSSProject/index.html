            <h3>Asimov Book Covers</h3>
            <p>These are bookcovers designed for a trilogy of books from the Robot series by Isaac Asimov. Each cover had to relate to each other so people would know that they belong together but still different enough to set each apart. This was a fun project for me because my husband loves these books. </p>
